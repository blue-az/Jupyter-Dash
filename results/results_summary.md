## Per-Class Performance

| Method               | Class 3 F1 | Class 5 F1 | Class 8 F1 |
|----------------------|------------|------------|------------|
| Standard LDA         | ~0.89      | ~0.90      | ~0.95      |
| PCA + LDA            | ~0.90      | ~0.91      | ~0.95      |
| Class-Specific PCA   | ~0.91      | ~0.93      | ~0.96      |
| Regularized LDA      | ~0.90      | ~0.91      | ~0.95      |
| Block Averaging      | ~0.90      | ~0.92      | ~0.95      |
| Logistic Regression  | ~0.92      | ~0.93      | ~0.96      |

## Key Findings

1. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Both PCA and block averaging effectively reduce the feature space while maintaining or improving classification performance. Block averaging reduced dimensions from 256 to just 25 while preserving the essential information for classification.

2. **Method Comparison**: Methods with dimensionality reduction generally outperform standard LDA on the original 256-dimensional space, demonstrating that we can achieve both better accuracy and faster computation by focusing on the most important features.

3. **Class-Specific Approaches**: Tailoring feature extraction to each digit class captures class-specific characteristics, leading to improved performance, especially for difficult-to-distinguish digits like 3 and 5.

4. **Regularization**: Both regularized LDA and L1-regularized logistic regression help prevent overfitting and improve generalization, especially when working with high-dimensional data.

5. **Practical Considerations**: Block averaging stands out as a particularly practical approach, significantly reducing dimensionality while maintaining high accuracy, and it's conceptually simple to understand and implement.

## Best Performers

- **Most Accurate Method**: Class-Specific PCA + LDA and Logistic Regression (L1) tied at ~93% accuracy
- **Fastest Method**: Block Averaging + LDA (~0.05 seconds)
- **Best Dimensionality Reduction**: Block Averaging (256 → 25 features, 10× reduction)
- **Best Method for Digit 3**: Logistic Regression (F1 ~0.92)
- **Best Method for Digit 5**: Class-Specific PCA + LDA and Logistic Regression (F1 ~0.93)
- **Best Method for Digit 8**: Class-Specific PCA + LDA and Logistic Regression (F1 ~0.96)

## Recommendations

### For Accuracy-Focused Applications
Class-Specific PCA + LDA or Logistic Regression with L1 regularization provide the best classification performance across all digits.

### For Speed-Focused Applications
Block Averaging + LDA offers the best trade-off between computational efficiency and accuracy, with the fastest execution time while maintaining competitive accuracy.

### For Interpretability
Logistic Regression with L1 regularization provides a sparse model with feature selection, making it easier to interpret which features are most important for classification.

## Next Steps

- Try different block sizes for block averaging to find the optimal trade-off between dimensionality reduction and accuracy
- Extend the analysis to all 10 digits (0-9) instead of just digits 3, 5, and 8
- Explore other dimensionality reduction techniques like t-SNE or UMAP
- Implement more advanced models like neural networks and compare their performance to these classical methods
- Apply ensemble methods to combine the strengths of different approaches

This analysis provides a solid foundation for understanding the zip code digit classification problem and offers insights into effective approaches for similar image classification tasks with high-dimensional data.
